# Sass Door ðŸšª
``Hello ( Â´ Ï‰ ` )ãƒŽï¾ž`` thanks a lot for being interested in this library. Here's the story, even though I really like SCSS, I find it distant from the things I deeply love. I feel uneasy that the general direction of Sass as a programming tool is becoming more and more unaligned with my own path as a developer. I think there are so many more robust and complex things that can be done using it if only it had a some upgrades.

 - **Type Safety** - Having Sass behave a little more like TypeScript or Rust would be fantastic. Having data types for different units and keywords would be helpful for writing functions and mixins.
 - **Error Handling** - There are only three at-rules `@error`, `@warn`, and `@debug` that help somewhat in handling errors. Simply having a `throw()` function and mixin would make a huge difference.
 - **Basic Utilities** - Some staples are missing in the official modules, type conversions, transformations, and others.

These are the scope of things I can add myself. These three upgrades can mostly be done using Sass itself and rather slimly. If I could vent for a second, what I believe this language desperately needs that can only be correctly done by modifying the Dart source code are: hard typing, callback functions, complete modularity, and unit tests (I know about Sass True and appreciate it but I think that it is limited due to having a Sass implementation).

## Setup
The simplest way to setup Sass Door is to install it in a node project:
```bash
npm i sass-door -D
```
But in the case you're not using Node in your project you can import it as a git submodule or simply by copying `~/index.scss` to your project.

## Usage
To use this library, one must simply import it using the `@use` sass keyword and target the root of the project.
```scss
@use 'path/to/sass-door' as *;
```

## Type Safety
Type safety is a crucial aspect in any programming language, and the absence of it is nothing short of a calamity. It's like driving on treacherous roads without brakes, a recipe for disaster. Type validation, my friends, provides a shield of sanity in the chaotic realm of software development. It ensures that variables are used in a manner that aligns with their declared types, preventing a myriad of bugs and runtime errors that can plague codebases like an unstoppable virus.

It's a vital tool for taming complexity, for it compels us to write code that is robust, predictable, and self-explanatory. Without it, we descend into a realm of uncertainty and untraceable errors, a land of darkness where debugging becomes an exercise in futility. So let us cherish and demand type safety in our programming languages, for it empowers us to write code that is reliable, maintainable, and worthy of our craft.

### Basic argument type
With a few functions, a big map, and a little imagination we can simulate type safety right here in SCSS. _If only Scss would become rusty..._ So let's see the first example, say a simple function like one that squares a number. Given a scope for only number types (there won't be squaring strings, booleans, colors, etc) and a missing `@return` expression on the flow where the type does not match.
```scss
@use 'path/to/sass-door' as *;

@function sq($n) {
  @if not check($n, 'number') {
    @return -1;
  }
  
  @return $n * $n;
}
```

### Union types
*Coming soon*
```scss
@use 'path/to/sass-door' as *;
```

### Interface types
*Coming soon*
```scss
@use 'path/to/sass-door' as *;
```

### Types in unit testing
Whenever unit tests come to mind in SCSS code, the only option is [True by Oddbird](github.com/oddbird/true). It is a fantastic library that, alone, makes unit testing available in Sass. Also, this is a modified version of the example function `sq()`, now the flow where the type does not match is accounted for and must be tested.
```scss
@use 'path/to/sass-door' as *;
@use 'true' as *;

@function sq($n) {
  @if not check($n, 'number') {
    @return -1;
  }
  @return $n * $n;
}

@include test-module('Number functions') {
  @include describe('@function sq($num)') {
    @include it('Correctly squares a number') {
      @include assert-equal(sq(12), 144);
    }
    @include it('Returns -1 with types other than a number') {
      @include assert-equal(sq('12'), -1);
    }
  }
}
```
When running the testing command, this is what the terminal would show:
```bash
Number functions
  @function sq($num)
    âœ” Correctly squares a number
    âœ” Returns -1 with types other than number
```

### Type safety and mixins
*Coming soon*
```scss
@use 'path/to/sass-door' as *;
```

## Error Handling
*Coming soon*

### Error handling in functions
Once imported, the error-handling functions become available for usage. For example, this is how it would look like:
```scss
@use 'path/to/lib/sass-door.scss' as *;

@function example-function($ok) {
  @if not $ok {
    $error: throw('Incorrect input');
    @return false;
  }
  @return true;
}
```
And once the `throw()` happens, it would look like this in the terminal:
```bash
Error: "Incorrect input"
  â•·
5 â”‚     $error: throw('Incorrect input');
  â”‚             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  â•µ
  path/to/index.scss 5:13 example-function()
```
As an additional feature, the error message string is also returned in the `throw()` function. This is useful for unit testing.
```scss
@debug example-function(false); // Debug: Incorrect input
```

### Error handling in mixins
There's also the `throw()` mixin, whose name is exactly the same as the `throw()` function, but the mixin must be called using the `@include` keyword.
```scss
@use 'path/to/lib/sass-door.scss' as *;

@mixin example-mixin($ok) {
  @if not $ok {
    @include throw('Incorrect input');
  }
}
```
And once the `throw()` happens, it would look like this in the terminal:
```bash
Error: "Incorrect input"
   â•·
5  â”‚   --scss-error: '#{throw($message, $catch)}';
   â”‚                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   â•µ
   path/to/index.scss 5:5 example-mixin()
```
As an additional feature, the error messa ge string is also applied as a custom CSS property called `--scss-error`. This is also useful for unit testing mixins.
```scss
.example {
  @include example-mixin(false);
}
//  .example {
//    .scss-error {
//      --scss-error: "Incorrect input";
//    }
//  }
```

## Sass Basics
Sass is a niche problem as a language with limited features. My opinion is that it can be much more. These are a set of functions and mixins (abbreviated as `@f` and `@m`) that do things that aren't available in the official SCSS modules. I just think they're neat.

- `@f` [`capitalize()`]() - Turns the first letter of a string into uppercase.
- `@f` [`separator-character()`]() - Returns the character value that corresponds with the separator "enum" built in sass.
- `@f` [`substring-match()`]() - This function checks if a string contains ('*'), starts with ('^'), or ends with ('$') a substring.
- `@f` [`to-string()`]() - This function converts a value of any type into a string.
- `@f` [`map-next-key()`]() - Returns the next key in a map given the current key. 
- `@m` [`map-to-styles()`]() - Displays a map as a list of style values.
- `@f` [`map-map()`]() - This funcion processes every value of a map using a callback function.
- `@f` [`list-remove()`]() - Removes the element at the given index from a list.
- `@f` [`list-cut()`]() - Returns a new list containing the first _n_ elements of the given list.
- `@m` [`quick-mq()`]() - Optionally applies a media query.
- `@m` [`quick-pseudo()`]() - Optionally applies a pseudoclass.
- `@m` [`conditional-selector()`]() - Creates a selector based on a conditional value.

## Configuration
I would recommend in your file structure have a `/lib/` directory where you can import Sass Door's index scss. This snippet contains all configurable variables with their default value. [Read more](https://carcajadaartificial.github.io/sass-door/#config-variable)
```scss
// ~/lib/sass-door.scss
@forward 'path/to/sass-door' with (
  $catching-enabled: true,
  $mixin-style-name: '--scss-error',
);
```
